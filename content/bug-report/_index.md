Being this currently a one-man effort that consumes a lot of time, contributions are welcome.

To contribute some package or some other change, just follow the usual process for submitting [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests) and create a [pull request on the project repository](https://github.com/pinetoo/pinetoo/pulls).

Please also keep in mind what is explained in the [versioning]({{< relref "versioning" >}}) and consider whether you should be pushing your request to `master` or some other branch.

This repository tries to follow Gentoo's policies and best practices for ebuilds and Git commits in terms of quality and coding style. Some of those policies and practices are documented in [GLEPs](https://www.gentoo.org/glep/).

You should run `pkgcheck` on the code you are contributing and making sure it's as much clear of errors, warnings or other kind of notices as possible.
